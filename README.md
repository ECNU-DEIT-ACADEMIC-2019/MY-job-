1.Background

With the development of Open Educational Resources，Massive Open Online Courses have attracted more attention。 MOOC is a free and open 
online course for the public , chinese name is “MU CLASS”。2012 is called as the year of MOOC.

2.Overview of the platform

3.Key elements Analysis

3.1 the environment(Where to learn)

This MOOC platform is a completely open and free learning space, learners are completely responsible for themselves, from the beginning 
of course selection to finish the course learning, the whole process is controlled by learners. Which puts forward higher requirements 
for learners.It can be regarded as one of the online learning environment.We can use computers or other mobile devices to learn some 
courses.We can either open the web page of this platform through the browser in the computer or use the application program in the 
mobile devices to learn, the interface design is very simple and generous, and has high ease of use.We can also download these course 
videos to watch repeatly without the Internet,so we can consolidate knowledge and deepen our understanding.Compared with traditional 
teaching,one of the biggest advantages is that we can watch videos over and over again.It means that the teaching situation can be 
reproduced.This is benificial for us to make continuous knowledge construction in the teaching situation.We can also learn at any time 
and anywhere.In general,the design of this platform is friend and convenient to different learners.Learners can learn how to use 
easily,so its learning environment is comfortable.

3.2 Knowledge、skills、attitude(What to learn)

This platform provides mainly about knowledge learning which based on the excellent courses of many famous universities in 
China.Bloom(1913-1999) divided educational goals into three categories: cognitive, emotional and operational.Learners can learn these 
three abilities by learning the courses on the platform and completing the learning goals.Firstly,learners watch a kind of course 
instrutional videos and complete relevant exercises dependently,they can learn about knowledge.Secondly,Learners can also enhance their 
knowledge by participating in the communication and discussion with others, at the same time, they can learn information skills and 
cultivate a good learning attitude.FInally,one to be able to complete a course of learning until the final certification is also a test of individual learning attitude.


3.3 Behavior(Effect of learning)

In the process of watching instructional videos, when we learn to the important knowledge,tnere are some relevant exercises are inserted 
into it. Only after we have finished these exercises can we continue to watch, which is helpful to examine the previous learned content 
for us,at the same time strengthen the memory and application of the learned content in time. After each class learners can communicate 
with others in time and share views, this process can help enhance everyone's understanding, so the Effect of learning also will be 
better.For me, the overall learning effect is pretty good, course learning is not only a whole management process of our own, but also we can with more people to exchange learning, get a lot.

3.4 Interaction(How to learn,The manner,The media)

The learning on the platform is completely open and autonomous, the learning resources include mainly the teacher's teaching videos. In the process of watching the videos, we also need to do some exercises, after learning a lesson, there are also some corresponding after-class exercises, after we finish them,the system will automatically correct and timely feedback, so that we can correct the mistakes in time, which all belongs to human-computer interaction. In learning, we can share views in the discussion and communication section to put forward confusion, learners will build a virtual learning community, teachers usually will also participate in these communication, which belongs to interpersonal interaction. They are all carried on through the network.

3.5 Experience(The process,Feelings)

3.6 Interact object(From who to learn)

We acquire knowledge mainly by watching the teacher's instrucstional videos. The instrucstional mode is very similar to the traditional education,  the difference is that the classroom instruction is moved on the screens. We need to complete the homework assigned by the teacher, the system will automatically corrects and remind you what knowledge you have not mastered.participate in the study section of the problem discussion and communication, can help learners develop critical thinking, build a knowledge map to internalize knowledge. In short, we can learn knowledge from teachers, systems and partners by interaction.

4.Analysis and improvement

To a large extent, the teaching mode of MOOC is still a replica of traditional lectures(jiao jianli,2013).It is still an undoubted fact that the high elimination rate of MOOC curriculum and the low social recognition of teaching quality(yang yonglin,2013).Some studies have shown that the withdrawal rate of learners in MOOC is high, generally between 85 to 95 percent(hao dan,2013).Many learners may be motivated to join the course for a while, it may also be to deal with knowledge anxiety, or it may be purely for learning knowledge or any other reasons. For professionals who have worked, the learning rate of the course may be low which due to work problems,time conflicts and other reasons, the platform needs to coordinate these problems.

5.conclusion 

For MOOC, the low completion rate of MOOC learning, the lack of learning sustainability, the lack of participation of MOOC learners and the lack of learning investment are the problems what should be solved in the future.
